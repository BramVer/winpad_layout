## winpad_layout

This is a shameless ripoff of [janten/keypad-layout](https://github.com/janten/keypad-layout) for all those of us that cannot afford a Mac to run it.

### Who it works

Subdivides your monitor (multiple monitor setup support is included) into nine sections resembling the layout of the numeric keypad. Press Ctrl plus subsequently to numbers on the control pad to select the sections for the active foreground window.

### Build it

Builds with CMake and a Visual Studio 2015 environment.

### Installation

None required. Just run the executable.

### Deinstallation

Stop the process by choosing 'Close' in the popup menu of it's tray icon. Delete the exectuable.
